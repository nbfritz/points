# Points

This is my toy project for testing new technologies and features. It is a scorekeeping app for various boardgames. It allows each player to pull up the game on a separate form and update their score (and other game stats) with the changes immediately being visible to the other players.

It's a simple problem, with some interesting nuances that lets me dig into various aspects of a web framework.

This is the vanilla Rails version, initialized with plain old `rails new` with no other options than what is default as of the date I ran the command in April 2025. I may add additional libraries, but the goal is to keep this version as close to Rails-only best practices as possible.
